An applications that takes the day of birth of the user and return their akan name for the day

HOW TO DOWNLOAD
==========================
	using git; clone the repository : "git clone https://github.com/abdulmuhsinGH/angular-seed-akanNAme.git"

	or from github there is a download link to donwload the app's source code as a zip file. 
Testing 
==========================
	to test the code you need to run the npm test. before doing the test you need to make sure that you have installed the npm. the is done by running the command "npm install" in the directory in which the akanName app was cloned in your local drive. the npm must be installed in the folder in which the akanName soure code is found.  To run the npm test run "npm test" in the same directory with your command prompt. 


The angular-seed app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in
[Jasmine][jasmine], which we run with the [Karma Test Runner][karma]. We provide a Karma
configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`
* the unit tests are found in next to the code they are testing and are named as `..._test.js`.

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and
watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit.  This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected.  The project contains a
predefined script to do this:
```
npm run test-single-run
```
(from angular readme file)
Running the App
==========================
	to run the app on your local server you need to start npm server. This is done by running "npm start" in the directory in which you installed the npm.
