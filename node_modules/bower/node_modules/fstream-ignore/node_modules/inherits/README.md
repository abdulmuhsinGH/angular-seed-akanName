A dead simple way to do inheritance in JS.

    var inherits = require("inherits")

    function Animal () {
      this.alive = true
    }
    Animal.prototype.say = function (what) {
      console.log(what)
    }

    inherits(Dog, Animal)
    function Dog () {
      Dog.super.apply(this)
    }
    Dog.prototype.sniff = function () {
      this.say("sniff sniff")
    }
    Dog.prototype.bark = function () {
      this.say("woof woof")
    }

    inherits(Chihuahua, Dog)
    function Chihuahua () {
      Chihuahua.super.apply(this)
    }
    Chihuahua.prototype.bark = function () {
      this.say("yip yip")
    }

    // also works
    function Cat () {
      Cat.super.apply(this)
    }
    Cat.prototype.hiss = function () {
      this.say("CHSKKSS!!")
    }
    inherits(Cat, Animal, {
      meow: function () { this.say("miao miao") }
    })
    Cat.prototype.purr = function () {
      this.say("purr purr")
    }


    var c = new Chihuahua
    assert(c instanceof Chihuahua)
    assert(c instanceof Dog)
    assert(c instanceof Animal)

The actual function is laughably small.  10-lines small.
=======
Browser-friendly inheritance fully compatible with standard node.js
[inherits](http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inherits_constructor_superconstructor).

This package exports standard `inherits` from node.js `util` module in
node environment, but also provides alternative browser-friendly
implementation through [browser
field](https://gist.github.com/shtylman/4339901). Alternative
implementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone
module to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old
browsers with no `Object.create` support.

While keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`
implementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not
include full `util` package to your client code if all you need is
just `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`
package is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need
from it.

It's recommended to use this package instead of
`require('util').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used
not only in node.js but in browser too.

## usage

```js
var inherits = require('inherits');
// then use exactly as the standard one
```

## note on version ~1.0

Version ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible
neither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.

If you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be
careful:

* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing
  superclass
* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any
  existing fields on it
